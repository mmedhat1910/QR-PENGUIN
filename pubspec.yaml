    # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
    # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
    # the material Icons class.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/fonts/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Montserrat
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
                weight: 600
              - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Light.ttf
                weight: 200
              - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Italic.ttf
                style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
